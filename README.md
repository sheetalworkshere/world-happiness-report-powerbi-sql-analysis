## Objectives

- Identify the major factors contributing to happiness.
- Analyze trends in happiness scores over time.
- Compare happiness levels across countries and regions.
- Visualize relationships between economic, social, and health-related factors.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

**Tool:** Excel  

**Steps:**
- Cleaned missing and inconsistent values.
- Removed unnecessary rows and columns.
- Renamed columns for clarity and better readability.
- Created new KPI columns for key metrics.
- Conducted initial exploration using Pivot Tables to calculate:
  - Average happiness by country
  - Top and bottom countries by happiness score
  - Yearly trends for happiness score and GDP

These steps ensured the dataset was accurate and ready for deeper analysis.

## SQL Analysis and Insights

**Tool:** SQL Server  

**Key Insights Derived:**
- Calculated averages for GDP per Capita, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Generosity, Corruption, and Social Support.
- Analyzed GDP distribution across regions to identify economic disparities.
- Identified the top 10 happiest and saddest countries based on average scores.
- Explored relationships between happiness and other socio-economic indicators.

SQL queries were used to uncover hidden patterns and correlations within the dataset.

## Power BI Dashboard

**Tool:** Microsoft Power BI  

The interactive dashboard was designed to present all insights clearly and effectively.

**Dashboard Features:**
- KPI Cards for key indicators (GDP, Freedom, Life Expectancy, Corruption, Generosity, Social Support, Happiness Score).
- Matrix view for comparing metrics by year and region.
- Bar charts showing top 10 happiest and saddest countries.
- Scatter plot visualizing the relationship between Life Expectancy and Happiness.
- World map highlighting Freedom and Happiness Scores by country.
- Year slicers (2015–2024) for time-based exploration.

The dashboard provides an intuitive way to interact with and interpret the data.

## Key Findings

- Sub-Saharan Africa showed some of the highest GDP per Capita values.
- Afghanistan ranked as the saddest country, while Australia ranked as the happiest.
- Freedom and Social Support have a strong positive correlation with happiness.
- Corruption negatively affects happiness levels.
- The global average happiness score is approximately 4.96, indicating moderate overall well-being.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights that happiness is influenced by a combination of economic, social, and health-related factors.  
While higher GDP contributes to better living standards, factors such as freedom, social support, trust, and life expectancy play a significant role in determining overall happiness.

The Power BI dashboard integrates these findings, offering an interactive platform for exploring the data in depth.
